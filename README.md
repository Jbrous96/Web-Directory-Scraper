# Web-Directory-Scraper
This scrapes all pages of a website and then outputs it into a json file. It includes all image attachments/url's as well.

Make sure to install all the required files seen at the top of the python file and then in your terminal run: python my_six.py

You will be prompted to input the desired site at that point. After the scraper completes it will output the results in a json file in the same directory as the python file
